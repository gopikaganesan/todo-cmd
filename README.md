Hey there!!

This is a Console Todo App

You can run this by following Steps

Step 1: 
	Install jdk latest version(RECOMMENDED) or greater than 8
	
Step 2: 
	Set the environment variable path for java
	
Step 3: 
	Download the source code
	
Step 4: 
	Go to the directory which contains your source code using `cd` command in your `CLI`
	
Step 5: 
	Compile the source code `Todo.java` by typing `javac Todo.java`
	
Step 6: (Optional)
	You can create .bat file or .sh file based on your OS for running this code instead of typing the command in step 7

	Example:
		'todo.bat' file contains the below line
			java todo %1 %2 %3 %4 %5

		Here %n -> n represent nth argument.. You can have 0 to n arguments while running the code

In Step 7 instead of `java Todo` you can use `todo.bat` for running the code

	#Since .bat supports only on windows you can try .sh or prefer step 7

Step 7:
	Run the application by simple typing `java Todo` 
	Usage will be displayed.. Now you can follow it


###NOTE

`cd` - command for change directory

`CLI` represents COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

`javac` - used for compiling java code


While running the code 2 files are created `todo.txt` and `done.txt`
